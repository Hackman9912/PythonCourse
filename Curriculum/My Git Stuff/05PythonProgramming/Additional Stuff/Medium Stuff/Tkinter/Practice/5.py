5. Property Tax
    A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent
    of the propertyâ€™s actual value. If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value
    is $6,000. The property tax is then $0.64 for each $100 of the assessment value. The tax
    for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $38.40. Write a GUI program that displays the
    assessment value and property tax when a user enters the actual value of a property.
