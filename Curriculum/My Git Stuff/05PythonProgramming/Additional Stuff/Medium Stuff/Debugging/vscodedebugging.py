for step over and step into
step over steps over the function

step into will step into the modules and funcitons to see what is happening within. It will step to functions when they are called to show what they are doing. 
Might need to be in same directory to show what is happening.
step over just steps over them and shows what is happening

step out steps out of a function to the original line that you stepped into the function from. Does not back track but continues with the program. IE I saw what I needed to see in the function
now I want to continue with the rest of the program
