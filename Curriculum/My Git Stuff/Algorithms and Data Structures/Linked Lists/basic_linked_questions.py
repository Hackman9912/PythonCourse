1. Using box and pointer notation, draw a picture of the nodes created by the 
first loop in the tester program. 

       _        _ __  ___        _ __  ___        _ __  ___        _ __  ___        _ __  ___  ___
 head |_|----->|_D1_||_5_|----->|_D2_||_4_|----->|_D3_||_3_|----->|_D4_||_2_|----->|_D5_||_1_||_/|

2. What happens when a programmer attempts to access a nodeâ€™s data fields when 
the node variable refers to None? How do you guard against it?
You get an attribute error
You assign a link

3. Write a code segment that transfers items from a full array to a singly linked 
structure. The operation should preserve the ordering of the items.
