5.11 What three actions do count-controlled loops typically perform using the counter variable?

5.12 When you increment a variable, what are you doing? When you decrement a variable, what are you doing?

5.13 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer number = 5
Set number = number + 1
Display number
```
5.14 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer counter
For counter = 1 To 5
   Display counter
End For
```
5.15 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer counter
For counter = 0 To 500 Step 100
  Display counter
End For
```
5.16 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer counter = 1
Constant Integer MAX = 8
While counter <= MAX
   Display counter
   Set counter = counter + 1
End While
```
5.17 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer counter = 1
Constant Integer MAX = 7
While counter <= MAX
   Display counter
   Set counter = counter + 2
End While
```
5.18 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer counter
Constant Integer MIN = 1
For counter = 5 To MIN Step â€“1
   Display counter
End For
```
5.19 A program that calculates the total of a series of numbers typically has what two elements?

5.20 What is an accumulator?

5.21 Should an accumulator be initialized to any specific value? Why or why not?

5.22 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer number1 = 10, number2 = 5
Set number1 = number1 + number2
Display number1
Display number2
```
5.23 Look at the following pseudocode. If it were a real program, what would it display?
```
Declare Integer counter, total = 0
For counter = 1 To 5
   Set total = total + counter
End For
Display total
```
